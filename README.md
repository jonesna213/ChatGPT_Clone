# ChatGPT Clone

## Goal
The goal of this project is for me to get familiar with using the openAI API. I thought what better way then to create a clone of ChatGPT.
I don't plan on creating any accounts or anything, but I want there to be conversations (which are saved in the browser). So, essentially
the same thing as the ChatGPT website not including accounts because thats not the purpose of this project as stated above.

## Technologies
I am going to be using Node as the backend and React for the frontend. Styles will be done with a mixture of bootstrap and custom css.
